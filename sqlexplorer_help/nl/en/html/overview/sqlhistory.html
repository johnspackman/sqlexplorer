<h1>SQL History</h1>

<p>Every statement that was succesfully executed is logged in the
SQL History view.</p>

<p><img src="history1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The
view shows the statement, the date and time when the statement was last
executed, which connection was used and how many times the statement
has been executed. The SQL statements can be filtered, sorted, removed
and opened in or appended to the SQL Editor.</p>
