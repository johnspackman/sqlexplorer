<h1>Connections View</h1>

<p>The Connections View shows you all the connection profiles
that you have set up. This is where you can create new connection
profiles, start new database connections or stop them. To create a new
connection profile, right click in the view and select 'New Connection
Profile' or use the action button with the same icon.</p>

<p>In
the new connection dialog, add the name of the driver and correct the
url. If you select the auto logon option, you'll also need to provide a
username and password. If this is not provided, you'll need to enter
the username and password every time you open a new connection.</p>

<p>After
the connection profile has been created, we can open a new connection
to the database by double clicking on the entry in the connections
view. Right clicking the connection, shows the options to close, commit
or rollback the connection. From here you can also create new SQL
Editors for this connection. The action buttons can be used to do the
same. Note that the commit and rollback buttons are only available if
you have not selected the autocommit option in the SQL Explorer
preferences page.</p>
