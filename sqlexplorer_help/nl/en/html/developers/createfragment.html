<h1>Creating a new plugin fragment for SQL Explorer</h1>

<p>This short tutorial shows you how to create a new plugin
fragment for SQL Explorer using eclipse. MySQL was used as an example
for this tutorial, but don't create a new MySQL plugin, it already
exists. Feel free to enhance it though ;-)</p>

<p>Before you start you need to have the SQL Explorer plugin
available in eclipse. It can be either installed as a plugin, or if you
downloaded the source from CVS and have a SQL Explorer project in your
workspace, that will work too.</p>

<p>Ok, let's get started.</p>

<p>Step 1: Select File &gt; New Project from the menu.</p>

<p>Step 2: In the new project wizard that has just appeared,
select Fragment Project and click next.</p>

<p>Step 3: Enter your project details. As the project name, use
sqlexplorer_&lt;yourdbname&gt;. The targeted runtime should be
set to eclipse 3.2.</p>

</p>

<p>Step 4: Here we have to enter a few more details.<br>

As the fragment id, use
'net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer.&lt;yourdbname&gt;'.<br>

For the fragment version, you can start from 1.0.0 if you like. For the
fragment name, I suggest using '&lt;yourdbname&gt; extension
for SQL
Explorer', but you are free to use anything you like. The fragment
provider should obviously be YOUR name.<br>

As
the plugin ID, enter 'net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer'. This is how your
fragment will know that it is an extension to the core SQL Explorer
plugin. For the minimum version, enter the version number of the SQL
Explorer version that you've got installed. This should be 3.0.0 or
higher.</p>

<p>Step
5: We're almost done. Eclipse has created your brand new fragment and
it should look almost the same as the one below. There are just a few
more things to add. In the project root, add a new folder 'icons',
we'll need this later on. In the source folder, add a new package named
'net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer.&lt;yourdbname&gt;' by right
clicking on
the folder and selecting New &gt; Package. Once the package is
created,
right click on the package and select New &gt; File. Create an
empty
file called 'text.properties'. We'll use this file later on to store
all text strings for the project. It is important that this file is in
the main package, otherwise it might not be found by the core plugin. </p>

<p>Congratulations. You've just created a new fragment project
for SQL Explorer. Now head on over to the <a href="http://www.sqlexplorer.org/exDetail.php">next section</a>
and create that feature you've been waiting to code! </p>
