<h1>I can help? Cool!</h1>

<p>Do you use SQL Explorer? Want to contribute something back to
the project? If you want to help out, just post a message in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=605856">forum</a>.<br>

This project needs:</p>

<p><b>Java Developers</b></p>

<p>Ecplise
SQL Explorer 3.5.0. has come a long way since the initial 2.2.4
version, but there are still plenty of things that can be improved and
a lot more database specific features that can be added. Don't have a
lot of experience programming in eclipse? Don't worry, we'll help you
along. Here's your chance to finally do something about your eclipse
knowledge!</p>

<p><b>Database Experts</b></p>

<p>Ok,
maybe not experts, but if you know how to get information out of a
database that could help us add new features that would be great!<br>

For example, if you know what SQL statement to use to get to the DDL of
a DB2 procedure, let us know and we can incorporate that feature into
SQL Explorer.</p>

<p><b>Writers</b></p>

<p>Eclipse SQL Explorer still doesn't have a good help file. It's
about time to fix this.</p>

<p><b>Financial Sponsors</b></p>

<p>Do you use SQL Explorer a lot? Like it? Got a dollar to spare?
You can donate it <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=132863">here</a>.
