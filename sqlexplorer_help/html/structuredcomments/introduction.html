<h1>Structured Comments</h1>


<p>Structured Comments are an extension to your SQL programming
which is
unique to SQL Explorer. &nbsp;By adding specially formatted
comments to your code you can communicate special instructions or tasks to SQL Explorer in a repeatable, scriptable manner; for example, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="macros.html">Macro Substitution</a> to define a constant value once and have it used everywhere in your code</li>
  <li>Use <a href="conditionals.html">Conditional Compilation</a> to vary the code deployed to the server, EG to enable debugging globally</li>
  <li>Define input and output <a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a> in calls to stored procedures</li>
  <li>Set <a href="logging.html">Logging Parameters</a></li>
  <li>Cause SQLExplorer to prompt the user interactively for values (not yet implemented, see v3.5.0.beta3) </li>
  <li>Export and import data from local files  (not yet implemented, see v3.5.0.beta3) </li>
  <li>Perform client-side JavaScript  (not yet implemented, see v4.0.0) </li>
</ul>
<p>The design of Structured Comments is such that using these
extensions,
while specific to SQL Explorer, will not make your code incompatible
with other tools (including those that came out-of-the-box with your
database product). &nbsp;This is because the commands are embeded
inside specially formatted comments which (because they are comments)
will be ignored by other products. &nbsp;The commands allow you to
define defaults and alternatives so that when your script is executed
by another tool they can have a sensible default behaviour, and it's
only when SQL Explorer runs them that they have special meaning.</p>


<h2>Structured Comment Syntax</h2>


A Structured Comment consists of&nbsp;"${" <span style="font-style: italic;">at the very start</span>
of a comment - no spaces should appear between the comment start and the "${". For single line comments (--) a
single space is allowed between the "--" and the "${" because some database systems require a space after "--" to
detect it as a single line comment. 
For example:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 558px; height: 52px;" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="code" width="50%">/*${define mymacro}&nbsp;12345*/<br>
      --${define mymacro2}&nbsp;12345<br>
      --&nbsp;${define mymacro3}&nbsp;12345<br>
      <br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">Correct</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">/* &nbsp;${define mymacro} */<br>
      --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;${define mymacro2}&nbsp;12345<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">Incorrect</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<br>
Once SQL Explorer has identified a comment as a Structured Comment, it
then looks for a command and parameters in the following form:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <span class="code" style="font-weight: bold;">${ </span><span class="code">command [parameter [parameter [...]] </span><span class="code" style="font-weight: bold;">}</span><span class="code"> [data]</span>
</div>
<br>
I.E., the "${" at the start of the comment, followed by a
command,&nbsp;zero or more parameters, and then a "}"; after this
can optionally come some arbitrary data - we'll see how this can be
used later.<br>
<br>
In the example above, the command is "define", it is given a parameter
of "mymacro", and has "12345" as the data; &nbsp;it's not hard to
guess that this Structured Comment defines a macro named "mymacro" and
sets it's value to "12345"!<br>
<br>

<h2>Inline vs. Grouped Commands</h2>

Most Structured Comment commands are inline, which is to say that they
exist in a single comment; however, some commands span several
comments, similar to begin...end constructs in programming languages
(called a Grouped command). &nbsp;Typically, whether a command is
inline or grouped depends on how you use it; for example, the <span class="code">ifdef</span> command is an inline command if you provide non-whitespace after the "}" but grouped if not. &nbsp;For example:<br>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="code">--${ifdef DEBUG} this is an inline ifdef</span><br class="code">

<span class="code">--$(ifdef !DEBUG}</span><br class="code">

<span class="code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a grouped ifdef</span><br class="code">

<span class="code">--${endif}</span><br>

</div>
