<h1>Eclipse SQL Explorer</h1>

<p>Eclipse SQL Explorer is a thin SQL client that allows you to
query
and browse any JDBC compliant database. It supports plugins with
specialized functionality for individual databases (Oracle, DB2 and
MySQL) and can be extended to include specialized support for other
databases.</p>

<p>The project started as a fork from the original <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfacedbc/">JFaceDb</a>
project which has gone commercial and uses some of the core libraries
of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/squirrel-sql/">SQuirreL
SQL</a>.</p>

<p>The application is available as a standalone client or as a
plugin for Eclipse 3.2 and above.</p>
