<h1>SQL Editor</h1>

<p>The SQL Editor provides the following features:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Executing queries using CTRL-ENTER</li>

  <li>Basic syntax coloring</li>

  <li>Basic Content Assist</li>

  <li>Overriding result limit</li>

  <li>Word wrapping (if enabled in preferences)</li>

  <li>Session/Catalog/Schema switching</li>

  <li>Loading/Saving SQL scripts</li>

  <li>Commit/Rollback buttons (if session is not in autocommit
mode)</li>

  <li>Display of query execution time of last run query</li>

</ul>

<img src="editor1.jpg" alt="">
<p>The SQL Editor is divided into two halves - the top half
contains your SQL quer(ies) while the bottom half (the results half)
shows the results of executing them against your database.</p>

<p>The results half &nbsp;contains a tab for the results of
each query
executed (by default any existing&nbsp; tabs are removed each time
you execute the query but you can change this in Preferences), with a
further tab for messages returned by the server.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The columns are sortable by clicking on the column header.</p>

<p>Different export options are available to export the query
results.</p>

<p><br>

Where a query returns messages from the server (for example, Stored
Procedures) the messages tab is used to provide more information:</p>

<img src="editor2.jpg" alt="editor2.jpg">
<p>In the screenshot above, the message tab shows the typical
results of executing a stored procedure against a database (in this
case Oracle) where the procedure has errors. &nbsp;In this
particular query there are no result sets so there is only the Messages
tab, in which it lists each message with a status, text position, a
snippet of the SQL that was executed (where appropriate) and the text
of the error message. &nbsp;Clicking on a line in the Messages tab
takes you to the line of text in the query which caused the error.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">NOTE: </span>in
this example you can see some new features in SQLExplorer v3.5.0 - the
two comments at the top of the query which begin "${define" are
Structured Comments, which are special comments which introduce
additional commands to SQLExplorer without introducing proprietary
extensions into your SQL scripts. &nbsp;The Structured Comments
feature introduces conditional compilation and macros, while upcoming
features include prompting for values, locale independance, overriding
content types, and scripted import and export).</p>
