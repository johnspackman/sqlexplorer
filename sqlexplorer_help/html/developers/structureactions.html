<h1>Creating new Database Structure Context Actions</h1>

<p>In this
tutorial we will be extending the
net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer.nodeContextAction extension point to add a
new context action (also known as right-click menu option) for table
nodes in the Database Structure tree. Let's create a 'Rename Table'
feature for a MySQL table.</p>

<p>As
you probably remember from the previous tutorials, the first step is to
add the extension point on the extensions tab of the fragment.xml.</p>

<p>Next, we create a new action by right clicking the extension
point and adding a new action.</p>

<p><img src="strucaction2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The
details for the extension point are very similar to the previous
extension points. The only new option we see here is the node-type
field. Using this field, we can select for which node types our action
will be available. For this example we will use 'table' as the node
type. It's possible to target multiple node types, by entering a comma
separated list of types in this field.</p>

<p>After you've generated the Java class, there are only 2
methods that we need to implement: <br>

<i>public String getText()</i>: This method should return
the text for our new action that is displayed in the context menu.<br>

<i>public void run()</i>: This method is executed when the
action is run by the user.</p>

<p>For the sake of brevity, only part of the code for the run
method is shown below. The full source is available <a href="http://eclipsesql.cvs.sourceforge.net/eclipsesql/sqlexplorer_mysql/src/net/sourceforge/sqlexplorer/mysql/actions/RenameTable.java?view=markup">here</a>.
In the mean time, let's have a look at some of the more interesting
lines.</p>

<p><i>Line 37</i>: _selectedNodes is a protected
attribute that contains an array of selected nodes in the database
structure view.</p>

<p><i>Line 40</i>:
_view is a protected attribute that contains a reference to the
DatabaseStructureView. You can use this to get to many things,
including a shell.</p>

<p><i>Line 40-52</i>: Standard SWT dialogs are used
to prompt for a new table name.</p>

<p><i>Line 57</i>:
Starting from the selected node, we can retrieve a session and it's
corresponding SQLConnection. Actions should always use the interactive
connection and never the background connection, which is reserved for
executing statements in a background thread.</p>

<p><i>Line 64</i>:
Because our action will change the name of the current node, we'll need
to force the tables' parent node to reload it's child nodes.</p>

<p><i>Line 65</i>:
_treeViewer is a protected attribute that contains the SWT TreeViewer
widget. Here we tell it to refresh the widget UI starting from the
tables' parent node.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to test our new action. When we run our
application, we see the new option available in the context menu.</p>

<p><img src="strucaction5.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After selecting the rename option, a dialog appears. Here we
can enter a new table name.</p>

<p>The table has just been renamed to abrandnewtablename. Another
new feature succesfully implemented!</p>
