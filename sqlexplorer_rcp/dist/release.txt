Release Notes SQL Explorer 3.6.1
This is the new main release for SQLExplorer. It contains only minor fixes. The main reason for this release
is to deliver RCP distributions based on Eclipse Helios 3.6.1. Nevertheless the plugin is still compatible
with Eclipse 3.3.0.
Changes:
* fixed: result set column labels sometimes ignored alias names (select some_col as label, ...)
* added: replace ${workspace_loc} in jdbc driver URLs
* fixed list drivers bug with file names containing spaces etc.see: https://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipsesql/forums/forum/450662/topic/3947666
