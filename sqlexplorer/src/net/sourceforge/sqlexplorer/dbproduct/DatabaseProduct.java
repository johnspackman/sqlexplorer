/**
 * A DatabaseProduct is the base class for representing a given database
 * platform, eg Oracle, DB2, MSSQL, etc etc and ideally each platform
 * supported will provide an implementation.
 * 
 * However, it is currently optional for a platform to provide an 
 * implementation - not doing so simply means that some features will not
 * be available.
 * 
 * Do NOT create an instance of DatabaseProduct directly - use 
 * DatabaseProductFactory instead.
 * 
 * 
 * HOW TO IMPLEMENT AN INSTANCE.
 * 
 * The implementations must provide a public static no-argument function
 * called getProductInstance() which returns an instance of a DatabaseProduct-
 * derived object - the function will be called repeatedly and the returned
 * value is expected to be a global singleton.
 * 
 * The name and class is very important - it must be exactly: 
 * 		net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer.[platform].dbproduct.DatabaseProduct
 * where "[platform]" is the SQuirreL platform identifier (IE "oracle", 
 * "mssql", etc etc).
 * 
 * Note: it is recommended that you derive your class from AbstractDatabaseProduct
 * 
 * The first implementation of this class was for Oracle so please look there
 * if you want some good examples.
