Provides parsers and tokenizers for reading SQL and breaking that SQL up into 
individual queries.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>

	<p>The main goal of this package is to provide a facility for easily reading and
	interpretting a) SQL commands and b) extensions called Structured Comments.</p>
	
	<p>Tokenization is done by the Tokenizer class, which scans a StringBuffer and
	spits out Tokenizer.Token objects; Token is a CharSequence which points onto
	the original StringBuffer in an attempt to save memory and time.</p>

	<p>Query parsers must all implement QueryParser, although it is suggested that any
	future implementations extend AbstractQueryParser to take some of the routine work
	out of implementation.  Derived from here is BasicQueryParser, the backwards 
	compatible implementation and AbstractSyntaxQueryParser - a base class for syntax
	aware parsers.  The QueryParsers spit out Query objects, which are also CharSequence
	based.</p>
	
	<p>AbstractSyntaxQueryParser provides both look ahead and look behind caching of
	Tokens, storage for a list of Query objects, and automatically employs a
	StructuredCommentParser if the preferences permit it.</p>
	
	<p>StructuredCommentParser is used to read special markup inside comments; this
	allows extensions to the SQL without necessarily requiring incompatibility with 
	pre-existing RDBMS implementations, and also provides a structured means to add
	new language features without conflicting with the underlying RDBMS.</p>
	
	<p>Command and its derived classes are the implemention of the structured comment
	extensions.</p>
