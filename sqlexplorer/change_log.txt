+. Changed result tab titles for output parameters
+. Fixed bug in Oracle where compound error messages have the first details excluded from the Messages tab
+. Fixed bug in Oracle where line numbers in anonymous pl/sql blocks are not processed properly
+. Fixed bug where named parameters might not show the output value if referenced more than once; also supported the case where output parameters are referenced more than once and therefore have multiple output values.
+. Drivers:
	+. Fixed bug where "Extra Class Path" jars were doubled up each time the preferences was saved.

3.5.0.beta2 - John Spackman, Zenesis Ltd

* Fixed Oracle query parser bug where "declare" was not handled properly, plus a few other 
	associated bugs, eg NullPointerException in comments, etc etc
* Fixed bug where DDL commands which caused a SQLException did not record line number info
* Added preference to not log "Success" messages in Messages Tab
* Fixed cannot close result tab by clicking "x"
* Use ResultSetMetaData to get precision & scale for numerical values, and made them right 
	justified.  Note changes to DataSet.
+. Fixed bad title in Export to Excel
+. Fixed bug where compile errors in Oracle could be duplicated
+. Added PostgreSQL plugin back in
+. Connections view now breaks down into alias -> user -> sessions & connections; connections 
	view API; drivers & aliases saved using custom code rather than the JavaBeans style given by
	SquirrelSQL; 
+. History stored as XML rather than custom text format (changes reqd for multiple users)
+. Editors will refuse to run more than one query at a time, and toolbar is disabled during query
	execution
+. Fixed bug where numbers with a high precision (17 or more) were truncated
+. Added support for multiple result sets returned from a single query
+. Added support for named input & output parameters, including Oracle cursors
+. SQL History now records all queries, including those that failed - this allows the user to see 
	which query caused an error
+. When saving untitled (i.e. scratch) files, SE now prompts the user to ask whether these should
	be saved within a project or in the filing system; Eclipse pretty much requires a project in 
	order to work properly so this is a good workaround.  The user can choose to set a default and
	not be asked again.
+. Document JSE versions, making Eclipse use JSE5 even if you're developing for 1.4, etc
+. Adjusted the perspective so that it includes the project explorer, and has a little rearranging
+. Fixed OracleXE login problem
+. NanoXml was not being used, so I removed it in favour of DOM4J
+. AbstractSQLExecution now inherits from Job, for better progress feedback and integration 
	with Eclipse thread management


3.5.0.beta1 - John Spackman, Zenesis Ltd
========================================
SQL Editor
* The separate SqlResultsView has been removed and the query results are now part of 
	the editor that executed them (they appear as tabs in the bottom part of the editor 
	view
* Messages from the database server are now checked for and retrieved after each query,
	and then added to a Messages tab (attached to the editor next to the result tabs).
	The line/column that caused the error is recorded and clicking on a row in the
	Messages tab takes you to the line/character that caused the error
* You no longer need to use special separator characters to break up your SQL code
	(currently this is only supported on Oracle but other databases can be relatively 
	easily added).
* Structured Comments are a new feature which allow you embed instructions to SQLExplorer
	in your SQL scripts.  This can be used for conditional compilation and for macro
	expansion (you'll recognise this straight away if you've previously used C/C++),
	but future versions will support asking the user questions, data type overriding,
	importing, exporting, and client-side scripting with JavaScript.  Because the commands
	are disguised in comments this facility will NOT make your script incompatable with 
	other tools.
* New preferences for:
	a) Clear result tabs on execute
	b) Use long captions on result tabs
	c) Stop processing queries when an error is found
	d) prompt to save modified editors when closing
* Prompt to save files before closing (optional - see preferences)
* Added support for opening files from Eclipse, I.E. via a Project
* Basic online help - this is based on the website plus documentation of new features
* There is a new DatabaseProduct class which can optionally be implemented by a database
	fragment to extend the data types supported and the query parser cabailities (see online 
	help)
* There are new general-purpose QueryParser and Tokenizer classes for reading SQL and Structured 
	Comments.
* Database-specific extensions are required to abstract database specific components which
	do not easily fit into the Eclipse plugin architecture (see DatabaseProduct).
* Added Structured Comments for macros, conditional compilation, and other scriptable 
	functionality without compromising compatability with other, standard SQL tools (this
	can be disabled in preferences).
* Refactored the Preference pages, simplifying the code and extracting commonality
* DataSet now uses reflection to determine data types; there is partial implementation of
	additional datatypes at the moment - work here was stalled and will be completed soon.
* Drivers are loaded by the ClassLoader of the database extension
