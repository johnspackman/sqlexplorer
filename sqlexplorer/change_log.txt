3.5.0.beta1 - John Spackman
===========================
SQL Editor
* The separate SqlResultsView has been removed and the query results are now part of 
	the editor that executed them (they appear as tabs in the bottom part of the editor 
	view
* Messages from the database server are now checked for and retrieved after each query,
	and then added to a Messages tab (attached to the editor next to the result tabs).
	The line/column that caused the error is recorded and clicking on a row in the
	Messages tab takes you to the line/character that caused the error
* A new QueryParser and Tokenizer have been written which accurately parse SQL; this is
	used to parse SQL and automatically determine how to break up the text into individual
	SQL queries to be passed to the database, based on the grammar of the SQL.  This is
	abstracted so that there are pluggable database-specific implementations for different
	database products - currently only Oracle is supported but new additions are fairly 
	trivial.
* Database-specific extensions are required to abstract database specific components which
	do not easily fit into the Eclipse plugin architecture (see DatabaseProduct).
* Added Structured Comments for macros, conditional compilation, and other scriptable 
	functionality without compromising compatability with other, standard SQL tools (this
	can be disabled in preferences).
* Refactored the Preference pages, simplifying the code and extracting commonality, and 
	added new preferences:
	a) Clear result tabs on execute
	b) Use long captions on result tabs
	c) Stop processing queries when an error is found
	d) prompt to save modified editors when closing
* Prompt to save files before closing (optional - see preferences)
* Added support for opening files from Eclipse, EG via a Project
* Basic online help (based on website, plus a few extra bits)
