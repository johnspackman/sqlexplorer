TODO Priorities.
==================
* Implement before official 3.0.0 release
^ Nice to haves..
? Just an idea at this point..

== STARTUP PERFORMANCE ==
^ make dictionary persistent, and only update on request (by right-clicking and choosing refresh in db structure view)
^ creating first editor is a bit slow..

^ add export option: insert statement file

== EDITOR STUFF ==
* review/fix sql editor content assist
* check preferences are being stored/restored properly after application exit
* fix/check color coding/font settings
^ add drag support for nodes from structure tree into sqleditor (select few columns and drop into editor to generate select statement)
^ add top 10 sql drop down in editor, sort of like in squirrel..
^ create extendible 'snippets' popup that allows you to choose a db specific keyword and paste/drop it into the editor.
  These could be organized by type, e.g. functions, rules, hints, ...   This way, you wouldn't have to remember every db specific
  implementation for TO_DATE('2000-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') for example.
