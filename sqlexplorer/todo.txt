== STARTUP PERFORMANCE ==
* make dictionary persistent, and only update on request (by right-clicking and choosing refresh in db structure view)
* creating first editor is a bit slow..

== DATASET ==
* add export option: insert statement file
* better row/column/cells copy support

== EDITOR STUFF ==
* review/fix sql editor content assist
* check preferences are being stored/restored properly after application exit
* fix/check color coding/font settings
* add drag support for nodes from structure tree into sqleditor (select few columns and drop into editor to generate select statement)
* create extendible 'snippets' popup that allows you to choose a db specific keyword and paste/drop it into the editor.
  These could be organized by type, e.g. functions, rules, hints, ...   This way, you wouldn't have to remember every db specific
  implementation for TO_DATE('2000-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') for example.

== GENERAL ==
* add help documentation in plugin
* add 'do not ask again' to some of the prompts
* create installer for standalone app
* create update manager for RCP

== OTHER (db specific?) ==
* create/modify table wizard
* drop table, other.. action
* rename action
* create index wizard
* more folders for all types of databases

== Driver preferences ==
* when driver is modified, validate classpath and try loading selected class
* copy driver modifies the original driver if an error occurred (e.g. invalid class)
